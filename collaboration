Questions:
How will we input the 2d data 2 the RNN? (At the moment, I am only classifying stream flow rate, or sediment flow).
Kevin: Found something. Try 3d CNN, p


How to reformat numerical float data to be input to RNN. Is float same as integer?
Safwan: Float is fine input to RNN.


The data is just too less to train a RNN from scratch. Unlike CNNs I can not seem to find a trajectory pre-trained RNN.
  Some of the classes have less than 10 samples (as low as 4). Practically impossible to train a deep architecture. Can we train maybe a single or double layer network?
Kevin: retrained motion tracking RNN


What architecture (we will need to understand RNN better).

Are there any pre-trained RNNs available like those in Keras, on trajectory data?
Kevin: Found something
